        Over half of the items in the vending machines on campus are liked by absolutely no one. Based on what’s left in
        the vending machine at the end of the day, it’s clear to every student and the staff who restocks the vending
        machine what sells and what doesn’t. Unfortunately, making changes to the vending machine will be at best,
        random, without input from the students themselves.

        Introducing Vending Vote: the democratic solution for UH Manoa students to get their favorite items inside of
        the vending machine. Staff will no longer be guessing as to what next hot item they should be putting for the
        week, now students will help the staff decide. Students who create an account in Vending Vote will participate
        in a monthly “voting game."
